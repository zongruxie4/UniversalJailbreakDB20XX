**Quick summary:** This companion contains *non-binding* legal templates and safety-focused wording intended to help maintainers and contributors document responsible disclosure, takedown requests, and rules-of-engagement. It is **not** legal advice.

## What this contains
- Fillable templates (DMCA-style takedown, cease & desist, vulnerability receipt, tester consent).
- Contributor legal rules (what must stay out of public commits).
- Playful "AI Lawyer" persona blurbs for README helper bots.

## Important legal disclaimers
- **Not legal advice.** Use these templates as starting points only. Consult a licensed attorney for enforceable notices or jurisdiction-specific work.  
- **Local laws vary.** Don’t assume these templates match rules in your country (e.g., Japan’s computer access laws, DMCA specifics, etc.).  
- **Sanitize before publishing.** Never publish unredacted PII, user data, credentials, or weaponized exploit code.
