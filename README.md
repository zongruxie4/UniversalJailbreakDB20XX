Samsoft Universal Jailbreak Research — FOR RESEARCH ONLY

This repository collects prompt patterns, failure cases, and mitigations observed during black-box prompt engineering research. All examples are archived for study, reproduction, and development of jailbreak-resistant systems. 
Usage policy:
• DO NOT use these materials to bypass model safeguards or enable illegal activity.
• Use only with consented/local models or properly provisioned research endpoints.
• Replace any actionable/unsafe examples with sanitized pseudo-prompts before public release.

## What this contains
- Fillable templates (DMCA-style takedown, cease & desist, vulnerability receipt, tester consent).
- Contributor legal rules (what must stay out of public commits).
- Playful "AI Lawyer" persona blurbs for README helper bots.

## Important legal disclaimers
- **Not legal advice.** Use these templates as starting points only. Consult a licensed attorney for enforceable notices or jurisdiction-specific work.  
- **Local laws vary.** Don’t assume these templates match rules in your country (e.g., Japan’s computer access laws, DMCA specifics, etc.).  
- **Sanitize before publishing.** Never publish unredacted PII, user data, credentials, or weaponized exploit code.
